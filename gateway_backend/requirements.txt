# Lambda Dependencies
# Note: boto3 and botocore are available in Lambda runtime by default
# but pinning versions ensures consistency across environments
#
# Lambda Python 3.12 Runtime (as of October 2024):
# - boto3: ~1.34.x (AWS managed, auto-updated)
# - botocore: ~1.34.x (AWS managed, auto-updated)
#
# Development versions (pinned for reproducibility):
boto3==1.40.55
botocore==1.40.55

# Note: These pinned versions are for local development and testing.
# Lambda runtime will use its own boto3 version, which is typically
# slightly behind the latest release. If you encounter version
# conflicts, you can remove these from the deployment package
# and rely on the Lambda runtime versions.
